# LinearRegressionOnBostonDataset

In this project, I have demonstrated the complete Data Science project. I took the Boston Dataset and applied Various Data Preprocessing and Visualization techniques.Next I applied some feature Engineering into the Dataset.
At last, I applied Linear Regression to predict the house price. Also I tested my model accuracy using various metrics like RMS, Adjusted R2. 

I also performed some Regularization Both L1 and L2 so that our model refrains from overfitting and we get a stable model.
